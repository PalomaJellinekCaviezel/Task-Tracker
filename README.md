# Task Tracker

Task tracking with a to-do list. You can log in to your user and save, check and delete your tasks.

## What I learned

In this project I learned how to manage different users in **localstorage**, saving a list of tasks for each registered user so that they can later view them in their session.

## The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Login and register with username and password.
- Add new tasks by providing name, category and description.
- View the details of each task. 
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Delete tasks.
- Enjoy the comfortable experience of a mobile application.
